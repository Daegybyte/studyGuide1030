# Q2 exam 1 practice
# For the following pseudocode, track the value of variables at the end of each iteration (immediately after executing line 05):

# 01  Set result to 1
# 02  Set counter to 1
# 03  While (counter < 5)
# 04      Set result to result * 2
# 05      Set counter to counter + 1

result = 1
counter = 1

while(counter < 5):
    result = result*2
    counter += 1
    print(counter, result)
