# Quick Reference Guide

## Sorting and Searching
```Selection Sort``` - repeatedly seeks out smallest in list ```A``` and moves to list ```B```. ie work is done in ```list A```<br/>

```Insertion Sort``` - Starts with what is at ```array[0]``` in ```list A```<br/>and moves to to the appropriate place in ```list B```. ie work is done in ```list B```<br/>

```Binary Search``` - Can only be performed on a sorted/ordered list<br/>
Consider the application of the binary search algorithm to the following list: ```List: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13```<br/>
How many list items are examined by the program when searching for values ```5,11,12```?
```5: 3```<br/>
```11: 2```<br/>
```12: 3``` all items must be checked to eliminate the possibility<br/>

```Sequential Search``` - for a list of length ```N``` items, the number of items ```at most``` that must<br/>be checked is ```N```. At best, it is ```1``` (if it the first item checked)<br/>```can find a given value in ANY list``` <br/>


## Memory
Kb --> Gb = ```2**20``` times larger <br/>
Mb --> Gb = ```2**10``` times larger <br/>
There are 1024Kb in 1Mb and 1024Mb in 1Gb<br/>
